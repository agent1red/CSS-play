============

This is the source repository for WATS1010: Introduction to Web Development
Basic CSS assignment. This assignment is designed to help you practice your
use of common CSS properties and patterns.

Please refer to the resources page within the course for additional information
about how to complete the assignment and resources about CSS.

Requirements
------------

To complete this assignment, you must write styles to create an elegant visual
presentation for the poem "Kubla Khan" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Your goal
is to create an elegant and appealing presentation for the information contained
in the index.html file. (Please note: You do not need to edit the HTML file to
complete this assignment.)

Be sure to complete all of the following steps:

1. Create styles that help **visually group** the information on the page.
2. **Remove the bullets** on lists where bullets do not help with readability.
3. Use at least **one background image** somewhere on the page.
4. Use two **fonts** on the page: One font for headings and another font for body
   text. (Do not use MORE than two fonts on the page.)
5. Use **margin** and **padding** to control spacing on the page.
6. Use **line-height** to make the text easily readable.
7. Use **background-color** and **color** to alter the appearance of a section.
8. Size the **image** that is included on the page appropriately.

Resources Provided
------------------

This repository contains the ``index.html`` file, a starter ``styles.css`` file
and and ``images`` directory with some images for you to use. One of the images
is included in the page with an ``<img>`` tag, and should be styled as content
on the page. The remaining images can be used as background images in style
definitions. You do not need to use all of the images that are provided. All of
the provided resources are cited on the index.html page. You do not need to
remove unused resources. (You do not need to edit the ``index.html`` file.)

Stretch Goals
-------------

If you want to take your styling further, you might try some of the following
challenges:

* Use ``first-letter`` to style the poem in a fancy way.
* Try to ``float`` the aside.
* Try to make the ``social-links`` list go horizontal.
* Use opacity in a ``background-color`` definition by using ``rgba`` color
  definition.
* Give something rounded corners using ``border-radius``.
